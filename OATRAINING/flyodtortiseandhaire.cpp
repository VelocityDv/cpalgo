// idea is to use slow and fast pointers

// slow - tortise -> moves 1
// fast - hare -moves 2

// if bare meets end, then no cycle in linked list

// if tortise and hare meet at same point cycle

// to find start of cycle move tortise at the root of linked list.

// when they meet again start of cycle
